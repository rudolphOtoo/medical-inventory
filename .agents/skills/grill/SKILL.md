# /grill & /grill-me

## Purpose
To actively "grill" the user before starting a complex task, ensuring perfect alignment, preventing assumptions, and establishing a shared "wavelength" on technical, architectural, and business decisions.

## Methodology
When the user requests a new feature, integration, or architectural shift that contains ambiguity or high-impact decisions, the AI must:
1. **Pause Execution:** Do not write code immediately.
2. **Draft a High-Level Plan:** Outline the expected approach.
3. **Initiate the Grill:** Ask targeted, piercing, and highly relevant questions.
   - Force the user to think about edge cases.
   - Challenge potential flaws in the initial request (e.g., "SQLite on ephemeral storage will be wiped, should we use Postgres?").
   - Clarify budget, scaling, and operational constraints.
4. **Wait for Alignment:** Only proceed once the user has answered the "grill" and full alignment is achieved.

## Tone
Direct, professional, consultative, and slightly interrogative to ensure absolute clarity. No fluff.
